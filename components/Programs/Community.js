                UNIGROW is an initiative dedicated to supporting farmers in
                transitioning from the informal sector to the formal sector. The
                program provides farmers with essential resources, knowledge,
                and training to improve their agricultural practices, increase
                productivity, and enhance their market access. It also assists
                in navigating the formalization process, including registration,
                compliance with regulations, and accessing financial support. By
                facilitating this transition, UNIGROW aims to improve the
                livelihoods and overall well-being of farmers and their
                communities.
